# wordle_solver
A little python project to help solve the daily Wordle game (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

Credit to Todd Wells (https://github.com/ttop) for the code to find the best starting word (https://github.com/ttop/wordle_starting_guess).
I rearranged his code to find the best word every time I reduce the list of accepted words.
